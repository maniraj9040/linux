4. Terminal Commands To Monitor & Manage Network.
	4.1. The IFCONFIG and related commands.
		The most common usage of command is to return the IP address of the system you are using. But you can also use it to 			initialize an interface, assign a new IP address and enable/disable the interface.
		
		
		1. The below command will print the IP address of the current machine.
			$ ifconfig
			
		2. To print the information related to a particular interface, run the following.
			$ ifconfig eth0
		
		3. Assign IP address and set gateway.
			$ ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
			
		4. Enable/disable an interface.
			$ ifup eth0
			$ ifdown eth0
			
	4.2. Some nice ping command examples.
		It’s basically to find out whether a machine on the network or the gateway is reachable. Here are some good examples.
		
		1. Increase/decrease ping time interval.
			$ ping -i 2 target
			$ ping -i 0.1 target
			
		2. Check if local I/F is active.
			$ ping 0
			$ ping localhost
			
		3. Update the size of the ping packet.
			$ ping -s 112 localhost
			The above command changes the default packet size from 56 to 112
			
		4. Timeout a ping request.
			$ ping -w 5 localhost
			
		5. Send X no. of packets and stop.
			$ ping -c X IP_ADDRESS			
			
	4.3. The TRACEROUTE command.
		It’s for troubleshooting the network issues. It prints the no. of hops taken to reach the target.			
			$ traceroute ubuntu.com
			
			
	4.4. The NETSTAT command.
		This command allows a user to monitor both incoming and outgoing network connections. Most of the operating systems 		support this command. Let’s see some of its real-time applications.	
			
		1. Listing all TCP and UDP connections opened at a time.
			$ netstat -a | more	
			
		2. List connections without resolving host, port and user name.
			$ netstat -an			

		3. Listing only TCP connections.
			$ netstat -at			
			
		4. Listing only UDP connections.
			$ netstat -au			

		5. Display TCP connections in Listen state.
			$ netstat -lt			
			
		6. Display UDP connections in Listen state.
			$ netstat -lu			
			
		7. Display service names with PID.
			$ netstat -tp			
			
		8. Print routing table summary.
			$ netstat -r			

		9. Retrieve IP address statistics.	
			$ netstat -g			
			
		10. Locate all programs in Listen state.
			$ netstat -ap | grep http
			
		11. Find the port of a program is using.
			$ netstat -ap | grep ssh	
		
		12. Show all ports listening with process PID.
			$ netstat -tlnp			

	4.5. The dig command.
		The full form of DIG command is domain information groper. It retrieves the DNS details like A record, CNAME, and MX 			records.			
			$ dig www.google.com
			
		1. Display only MX Records.
			$ dig -t MX ubuntu.com +noall +answer			
			
		2. Display only NS Records.
			$ dig -t NS ubuntu.com +noall +answer	
			
	4.6. Miscellaneous network Linux commands.
		1. Display all TCP sockets in use.
			$ lsof -nPi tcp			
			
		2. Resolve IP address from the hostname.
			$ host ubuntu.com
			
		3. MTR – Top like traceroute command.
			It combines the functionality of traceroute and ping tools. It examines the connectivity between the host and the 				given target system.
				$ mtr google.com
