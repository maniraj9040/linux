3 Ways to Find Out Which Process Listening on a Particular Port

	1. Using netstat Command
		netstat (network statistics) command is used to display information concerning network connections, routing tables, 		interface stats, and beyond. It is available on all Unix-like operating systems including Linux and also on Windows OS.
			$ netstat -ltnp | grep -w ':80' 
				
		In the above command, the flags.

		l – tells netstat to only show listening sockets.
		t – tells it to display tcp connections.
		n – instructs it to show numerical addresses.
		p – enables showing of the process ID and the process name.
		grep -w – shows matching of exact string (:80).
		
		Note: The netstat command is deprecated and replaced by the modern ss command(https://www.tecmint.com/find-out-which-process-listening-on-a-particular-port/) in Linux.


	2. Using lsof Command
		lsof command (List Open Files) is used to list all open files on a Linux system.
		
		To find the process/service listening on a particular port, type (specify the port).
			$ lsof -i :80
			
	3. Using fuser Command
		fuser command shows the PIDs of processes using the specified files or file systems in Linux.
		
		You can find the process/service listening on a particular port by running the command below (specify the port).
			$ fuser 80/tcp
		Then find the process name using PID number with the ps command like so.
			$ ps -p 2053 -o comm=
			$ ps -p 2381 -o comm=
